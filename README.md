# React Tinder Card Demo

A demo project to my [react-tinder-card](https://github.com/3DJakob/react-tinder-card) npm module.

## Try the demo

Try the demo on the gh-pages site [here!](https://3djakob.github.io/react-tinder-card-demo/)

## The code

Feel free to check out the code in `react-tinder-card-demo/src/examples` for a usage example of how this application uses the module.

The simple example is the minimum code needed to get you started.

The advanced example implements a state to dynamically remove swiped elements as well as using buttons to trigger swipes.

Both code examples can be tested on the [demo page.](https://3djakob.github.io/react-tinder-card-demo/)
